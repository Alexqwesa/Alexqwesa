# The anti-war statement:

I want to clearly define my position about the current Russia-Ukraine war. The decision to start a
military intrusion is taken **without any approval from citizens** of Russian Federation. I firmly
stand **against** any war and especially this particular war, but I can do almost nothing about it
except writing these words. Furthermore, I'm sure that the most russians are also **against this
war**, no matter what our propaganda may say. Here is my statement to the Government: I demand to
immediately **stop** the military operations and **withdraw** all military forces from all Ukraine's
territory.
